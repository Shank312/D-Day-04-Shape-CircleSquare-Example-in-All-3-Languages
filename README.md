# 🌐 Day 04 – Shape: Circle and Square Example in C++, Java, and Python

This repository contains a simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) demonstration of **abstraction** and **polymorphism** using the concept of `Shape`, `Circle`, and `Square` implemented in three languages:

- ✅ C++ (`shape.cpp`)
- ✅ Java (`Main.java`)
- ✅ Python (`shape.py`)

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- Class and object creation in C++, Java, and Python
- Inheritance using a base class `Shape`
- Overriding the `area()` method in derived classes `Circle` and `Square`
- Polymorphism: calling overridden methods using base class references

---

## 📁 File Structure

├── shape.cpp # C++ implementation
├── Main.java # Java implementation
├── shape.py # Python implementation


---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔹 Python
```bash
python shape.py
🔹 Java
javac Main.java
java Main

🔹 C++
g++ shape.cpp -o shape
./shape

🔧 Concepts Used
Abstraction: Shape defines a common interface.

Polymorphism: Each language overrides area() differently.

Inheritance: Circle and Square extend Shape.

📸 Example Output
Circle area: 78.5398
Square area: 25
